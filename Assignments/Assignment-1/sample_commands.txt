b) echo {con,pre}{sent,fer}{s,ed}

is similar to the distrivutive properties of foil and follows a specific pattern to output a word. However in this case, the function string is 
used along with three aruguments each containing two terms. Starting from the first argument to the third, the first term then the last term is
used in an argument by merging them on each of the consecutive terms in the following arguments. 
c) date
Displays the current date, time and time zone in a given format
d) whoami

e) cal 2000
Displays the calendar for the year 2000, containing each day, week, and month. 
f) cal 9 1752

second argument being for the year. It outputs the monthly calendar with the days as columns except in this case for one specified month and year. 
The unusual part is that this command prints only one month for the argument 9 being the ninth month, September.   
g) bc -l
This command is known as a calculator language that works along with arbitrary precision numbers while actively interacting
with statements to execute. The second command -l, is a long list format.
h) echo 5+4 | bc -1
The command "echo" is used to print out a text line, but since there are more commands following that rather than just printing out "5+4", the 
following commands execute the sum when 5+4 are added together mathematically.
