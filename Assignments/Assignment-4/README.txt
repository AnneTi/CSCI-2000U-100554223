#As instructed, I produced my CSV file by first downloading
#the Excel spreadsheet. Then I saved it in order to copy the required columns 
#from the Excel document, then pasting it into a new document. However, I
#accounted an error preventing me from opening the file. And so with
#the help of my peers, they helped me to fix this problem. First, the file
#had to be downloaded, then I opened the .xlsx file on LibreOffice Calc
#for Linux. Then, certain adjustments were made to edit the columns in order
#for the file to execute.After, I manually edited this file, this allowed
#me to open the file.This process allowed the program to capture and execute 
#the data by displaying all the points on the map when plotted.

#In order to find the radius of the disk was created,
#by first calculating the size of the outbreaks. This was done by dividing 
#the case, then multiplying it by 30. Then, if I encountered a situation
#where the value was too low to plot, I would simply add 5. This is the
#process I used to choose the radius.
